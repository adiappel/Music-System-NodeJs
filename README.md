The Music System app includes songs, collections and accounts.
All files are in the master branch.

The app is on http://localhost:3000/

* Get songs by CollectionId:
   http://localhost:3000/songs/in_collection/:collectionid

 For testing purposes we have:
 - 4 accounts (3 active and 1 inactive)
 - 5 collections (1 with 4 songs, 2 with 3 songs and 2 empty collections)
 - 9 songs (all of them are in collections, one of them is in two different collections)

check out the collections and who created them, you might know some of our accounts.

Have a great day :)
